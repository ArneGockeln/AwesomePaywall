### 3. Setup the StoreManager
To setup the StoreManager just import AwesomePaywall in your main app file and run a configuration task.
Don't forget to set the product identifiers, terms of use and privacy policy web urls!

```swift
import SwiftUI
// Import the Package
import AwesomePaywall

@main
struct ElatedApp: App {
    // Initialise the StoreManager
    @StateObject private var storeManager: StoreManager = .shared

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                // Add task to fetch the configuration and synchronise purchases
                .task {
                    // set an ordered list of product identifiers. First in list appears first in paywall.
                    let identifiers = [
                        "YourAppNamePro.Annual",
                        "YourAppNamePro.Weekly"
                    ]
                    
                    await storeManager.configure(productIdentifiers: identifiers,
                         termsOfUseUrl: "https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",
                         privacyUrl: "https://yourdomain.com/privacy"
                    ))
                }
        }
        // Make the StoreManager accessible to underlying views
        .environmentObject(self.storeManager)
    }
}
```

### 4. Add paywall to view
The paywall needs to get triggered by a state var. For example if a feature is only available to subscribers, toggle the state var and present the paywall.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AwesomePaywall

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isPaywallPresented: Bool = false
    @EnvironmentObject private var storeManager: StoreManager

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Toggle the paywall
            Button(action: { isPaywallPresented.toggle() }) {
                Text("Subscribe")
            }

            // Check if the current user is a paying customer
            if storeManager.isPayingCustomer() {
                Text("This is only for subscribers visible")
            }
        }
        // Add Paywall fullscreen cover
        .awesomePaywall(isPresented: $isPaywallPresented) {
            // This represents the Title and main Features
            PaywallHeroView()
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Style the Hero View
The hero view contains the title and main features above the product selector. It can be styled as you like. An example is available in `Example` folder.

Also the paywall has 2 color options. The backgroundColor and highlightColor.

```swift
.awesomePaywall(isPresented: $isPaywallPresented, backgroundColor: Color.white, highlightColor: Color.green) {
    PaywallHeroView()
}
```

The backgroundColor is fullscreen and the highlightColor tints the border of the selected product and the background of the trial switch.
