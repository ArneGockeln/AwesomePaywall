### 3. Setup the Paywall
To setup the paywall just import AwesomePaywall in your main app file and apply the view modifier to ContentView.
Don't forget to set the product identifiers, terms of use and privacy policy web urls!

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AwesomePaywall

@main
struct AppMain: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .awesomePaywall(with: APConfiguration(
                        productIDs: ["YourApp.Annual", "YourApp.Weekly"],
                        privacyUrl: URL(string: "https://yourdomain.com/privacy")!,
                        termsOfServiceUrl: URL(string: "https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/")!,
                        backgroundColor: Color.red,
                        foregroundColor: Color.black
                    )
                ) {
                    PaywallMarketingView()
                }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Present a paywall
The paywall needs to get triggered by a state var. For example if a feature is only available to subscribers, toggle the state var and present the paywall.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AwesomePaywall

struct ContentView: View {
    // Get access to the APStore
    @EnvironmentObject private var storeModel: APStore

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Toggle the paywall
            Button(action: { storeModel.isPaywallPresented.toggle() }) {
                Text("Subscribe")
            }

            // Check if the current user is a paying customer
            if storeModel.hasProSubscription {
                Text("This is only for subscribers visible")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Style the Marketing View
The marketing view contains a title and main features above the product selector. It can be styled as you like. An example is available in `Example` folder.

Also the paywall has 2 color options. The backgroundColor is fullscreen and the foregroundColor tints the border of the selected product and the background of the trial switch. 

```swift
.awesomePaywall(...) {
    PaywallMarketingView()
}
```
