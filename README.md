### 3. Setup the Paywall
To setup the paywall just import AwesomePaywall in your main app file and apply the view modifier to ContentView.
Don't forget to set the product identifiers, terms of service and privacy policy web urls!

The styling of your paywall can be customized by implementing a Paywall Template.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AwesomePaywall

struct ContentView: View {
    // Toggle paywall visibility
    @Environment(\.paywallToggleAction) var paywallToggleAction

    // Optional: use environment key .hasProSubscription for active customer checks
    @Environment(\.hasProSubscription) private var hasProSubscription

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Toggle the paywall
            Button(action: { paywallToggleAction?() }) {
                Text("Subscribe")
            }

            // Check if the current user is a paying customer
            if hasProSubscription {
                Text("This is only for subscribers visible")
            }
        }
        .awesomePaywall(with: PaywallConfiguration(
                productIDs: ["YourAppPro.Annual", "YourAppPro.Weekly"],
                privacyUrl: URL(string: "https://yourapp.com/privacy")!,
                termsOfServiceUrl: URL(string: "https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/")!)
        ) {
            PaywallDefaultTemplate(
                title: "Your Awesome App",
                features: [
                    .init(systemImageName: "list.star", title: "Unlimited Features"),
                    .init(systemImageName: "widget.large", title: "Become the X-Wing Copilot"),
                    .init(systemImageName: "lock.square.stack", title: "Remove Anoying Paywalls")
                ]
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Present a paywall
The paywall needs to get triggered by a state var. For example if a feature is only available to subscribers, toggle the state var by calling the `paywallToggleAction` and present the paywall.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AwesomePaywall

struct ContentView: View {
    // Toggle paywall visibility
    @Environment(\.paywallToggleAction) var paywallToggleAction

    // Optional: use environment key .hasProSubscription for active customer checks
    @Environment(\.hasProSubscription) private var hasProSubscription

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Toggle the paywall
            Button(action: { paywallToggleAction?() }) {
                Text("Subscribe")
            }

            // Check if the current user is a paying customer
            if hasProSubscription {
                Text("This is only for subscribers visible")
            }
        }
        .awesomePaywall(...)
    }
}
```

### 5. Style the Paywall View
You can style your paywall as you like. An example is available in the file `Example/PaywallDefaultTemplate.swift`.

```swift
.awesomePaywall(...) {
    PaywallDefaultTemplate(
        title: "Your Awesome App",
        features: [
            .init(systemImageName: "list.star", title: "Unlimited Features"),
            .init(systemImageName: "widget.large", title: "Become the X-Wing Copilot"),
            .init(systemImageName: "lock.square.stack", title: "Remove Anoying Paywalls")
        ]
    )
}
```

### 6. Actions
To show the paywall, purchase, restore purchase or simply show the legal urls, there are actions available in the environment.

```swift
// Toggle paywall visibility
@Environment(\.paywallToggleAction) var paywallToggleAction
// Call to restore purchased products
@Environment(\.paywallRestoreAction) private var restoreAction
// Call to show a legal web view
@Environment(\.paywallLegalSheetAction) private var legalSheetAction
// Call to purchase a product
@Environment(\.paywallPurchaseAction) private var purchaseAction
```
